# Contribution Guide: Training Video
 
### Step 1. Fork this repo!  
### Step 2. Review the video details, example video and example script: 

| Description | A training video teaches a specific concept, tool, product, or process. It is easily digestible and usually includes diagrams, demos, and other explanatory graphics.
| --- | --- |
| **Presentation** | Visuals may include screencast, diagrams, animations, or other explanatory graphics. Narration is done in the background (i.e. narrator is not named in the video). The video contains title card intro and Puppet-brand animated outro. |
| **Length** | Usually 1- 5 minutes (the shorter the better). |
| **Quality/Tone** | Friendly and authoritative. Narrated directly, in 2nd person (i.e. "Now click on the link" as opposed to "Now *we* click on the link" or "Now *I* click on the link". For more details on tone, defer to the [Puppet Content Style Guide](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/Writing/Tone).)
| **A/V Recording Settings** | See [Puppet Training Videos: Best Practices](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/SP/Puppet%27s+Training+Videos%3A+Best+Practices), [How to record audio and video for a screencast](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/SP/How+to+record+audio+and+video+for+a+screencast) and [Audio Recording 101](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/SP/Audio+Recording+101).
