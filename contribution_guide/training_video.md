# Contribution Guide: Training Video
 
### Step 1. Fork this repo!  
### Step 2. Review the video details, example video and example script: 

| Description | A training video is designed to teach on a specific concept, tool, product or process. It may be presented in a series based around a theme. It is designed to be easily digestible, and usually includes diagrams and other explanatory graphics.
| --- | --- |
| **Presentation** | Visuals may include screencast, diagrams, animations or other explanatory graphics. Narration is done 'in the background' (i.e. narrator is not named in the video). Contains title card intro and Puppet-brand animated outro. |
| **Length** | Usually 1- 5 minutes (the shorter the better). |
| **Quality/Tone** | Friendly and authoritative. Narrated directly, in 2nd person (i.e. "Now click on the link" as opposed to "Now *we* click on the link" or "Now *I* click on the link". For more details on tone, defer to the [Puppet Content Style Guide](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/Writing/Tone).)
| **A/V Recording Settings** | See [Puppet Training Videos: Best Practices](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/SP/Puppet%27s+Training+Videos%3A+Best+Practices), [How to record audio and video for a screencast](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/SP/How+to+record+audio+and+video+for+a+screencast) and [Audio Recording 101](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/SP/Audio+Recording+101).
