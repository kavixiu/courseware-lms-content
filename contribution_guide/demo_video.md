# Contribution Guide: Demo Video
 
### Step 1. Review the following: 

| Description | A demo video takes the viewer on a deep dive into understanding a single, specific product feature. 
| --- | --- |
| **Presentation** | Command-line screencast along with voiceover narration. <br>Contains title card intro and Puppet-brand animated outro. |
| **Length** | 15 - 60 minutes. |
| **Quality/Tone** | Friendly and authoritative. Narrated directly, in 1st person, as a real-time demonstration (i.e. "Now *I* click on the link" as opposed to "Now *we* click on the link". For more details on tone, defer to the [Puppet Content Style Guide](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/Writing/Tone).)
| **A/V Recording Settings** | See [Puppet Training Videos: Best Practices](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/SP/Puppet%27s+Training+Videos%3A+Best+Practices), [How to record audio and video for a screencast](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/SP/How+to+record+audio+and+video+for+a+screencast) and [Audio Recording 101](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/SP/Audio+Recording+101).

Now students report a much higher rate of success when learning Puppet."*

4 | Training Content | Walk through the training content. This is the meat of the content, containing all the navigation, concepts, links, step-by-step processes, etc. | 15-55 minutes |  *"I will start by ensuring that my computer has enough free memory for the Learning VM download. The Learning VM requires at least 3 gigs of unused space... Next, I'm going to navigate to the Learning VM download site and click the button to download the Learning VM. The download can take anywhere from 5 minutes to multiple hours..."* 
5 | Video Recap & Resources | A very brief recap about what the viewer has learned, and resources for where to find more information or people who can answer additional questions. | 3-5 sentences |  *"In this video I installed the Learning VM on my computer.
