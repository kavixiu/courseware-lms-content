# Train the Trainer

As an instructor, I need to know best practices for engaging learners
so that my students learn and courses are successful and enjoyable

As a new instructor, I need to understand course outcomes and Puppet best practices so that I can independently run my classes with confidence

As a seasoned instructor, I need to know how to present new material so that my students learn and courses are successful and enjoyable

## Module One: Teaching Adults

--Main points
Keep it practical and engaging 
* Students are goal oriented (what is in it for me?)

Respect student experience and knowledge
* Show relevance of material to students' lives (focus on them and their needs)
* Recognize they have much to add to the course (even if not verbally)
* Create a welcoming place where it is safe to participate (your job to stop disruptions)
* Give them tools and tips they will remember and use
