# Train the Trainer

As an instructor, I need to know best practices for engaging learners
so that my students learn and courses are successful and enjoyable

As a new instructor, I need to understand course outcomes and Puppet best practices so that I can independently run my classes with confidence

As a seasoned instructor, I need to know how to present new material so that my students learn and courses are successful and enjoyable

**What skills does a user need to practice in training?**
* Giving adults feedback
* Accessing resources for teaching: instructor guide, notes, etc
* Public speaking: voice level, move around the room, dealing with people 
* Working with groups and how to encourage interaction
* Addressing classroom challenges: disruptions, surprises, not knowing
* Understanding intercultural communication and norms
* Speaking about Puppet and its products with authority and confidence

**Outcomes**
* Decrease onboarding time for new instructors
* Increase NPS scores for training
* Decrease escalation and support needs for instructor-led trainings

**Methods**
* Create Puppet best practices for teaching & learning experience that focuses on quality
* Provide instructors with support, resources, and training they need to succeed
* Organize resources to provide instructors one place to go for all they need
* Present instructors with tips, strategies, and practical guides for teaching adults

## Module One: Fundamentals of Teaching Adults

#### Main Points
1. Keep it practical and engaging 
* Students are goal oriented (what is in it for me?)
* Students need multiple ways to participate (more than verbal check ins)
* Students need different learning strategies (more than lecture)
* Relate content to their jobs
* Encourage problem solving and digging into material

2. Respect student experience and time
* Show relevance of material to students' lives (focus on them and their needs)
* Recognize they have much to add to the course (even if not verbally)
* Create a welcoming place where it is safe to participate (your job to stop disruptions)
* Give them tools and tips they will remember and use
* Be realistic about the schedule and adjust as needed

#### Examples of this in the classroom
* short video clips
* interactive assessment

Get to know you exercise: Your goal is to learn their job, motivation, and level of knowledge in a respectful, subtle manner. 

Anonymous quizzes: Adults can be reluctant to share their weaknesses in front of others. To gauge retention outside of built-in checkpoints, consider using free online quizzes at the end of the day, or at the mid-point, to see how everyone is tracking.

Ready to use anecdotes: Have examples ready for your user profile. If working with folks who care about security, be sure you have some short examples ready to go. Diversify your examples and relate them to the people in your course.

Don't lie: If you do not know an answer, don't pretend. let them know you will check on that and get back to them. And then do that.

Keep a parking lot for errant ideas: To respect time and input, listen to what students have to say but add off-topic or potentially disrupting ideas to a parking lot, either on a board or virtual, where all students can access. Depending on the idea, you could encourage other students to weigh in via Slack on the issue, or you could come back to these ideas if time allows.

Respect space and time: Be clear with students about your personality and approach. Invite feedback from them so you can be sure they understand you. 

#### Summary
Adults need to know how the material will impact their work; how it fits with what they know; and why they should care. They are goal oriented and require lots of engagement and respect for their individual experiences.
