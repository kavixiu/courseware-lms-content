## Preparing for Class


### Don't wing it. Really.
You are super smart, but teaching for Puppet is about much more than technical skill, or even Puppet expertise. It is an intense relationship between you, some strangers, and Puppet. It forces you to anticipate questions and opportunities so that our community learns and leaves class feeling excited and ready to use Puppet. This module covers how to get ready for class the first, or 50th, time you teach.

__The Basics__

Run through every lab before you teach:
 
* Make notes on sections where you anticipate some hiccups or questions.
* Be ready to explain why the lab matters and how it relates to the learning objective listed for the module.
* Understand what the student will be doing in the lab and why they are doing it. 
* Have strategies ready for those students who get stuck or frustrated. 
* Have a back-up plan practiced and ready for a technical failure.

Check the instructor guide before each class: 

* Technology changes will be noted in the guide and you need to teach from the current course, not the one you used several months ago.
* You may not have taught in awhile--give yourself a week to prep and find any errors or issues with slides or technical setup.
* Read the troubleshooting guide before class. It gets updated as new issues are logged. It's your friend.

Know the product and how to promote it:

* Review the new product releases and features before class. Be ready for students' questions on the new feature or product they have seen advertised.
* Have resources ready for students to explore a product or feature that is not yet covered in the course. [link to blog/product page]

__The Human Element__

Each class has vastly different needs:

* Prepare anecdotes that bring learning objectives to life. Humans learn from stories more reliably than they do from statistics or data. Ensure that your anecdotes are appropriate and not political or biased or obscene.
* Cultural differences need to be respected. Not everyone verbally participates, and while it can be uncomfortable, silence is the norm for some students. Prepare ways to engage your class outside of verbal discussions.
* Consider the dynamic of expertise, background, gender, age, and location. All of these factors will heavily influence how each student participates, and you will need to adjust to where they are at instead of forcing them to learn the way you prefer. 
* Use the pre-engagement call for private trainings to learn about your audience, their motivation, and their experience. 
* Send an email before class to students in public and private trainings to set the tone for the class and make them feel welcome.

Prepare dynamic discussions:

* Decide ahead of time where you want to have a class discussion and how long the discussion should run.
* Have specific learning goals for the discussion: are students **applying a concept** they learned? Are they **analyzing** different strategies? Are they **explaining** complex concepts?
* Prepare notes to help you keep the discussion on track and on topic.

Run the classroom like a pro:

* Review the time estimates on the master outline for each module. Make sure your lecture or instruction fits within that time frame. Practice this. [link to outline]
* Practice your delivery before standing in front of a class. Record yourself to improve your delivery style, your voice level, and your body language. Ask for feedback from co-workers about your style and delivery.
* Show up early for class. Be there an hour in advance to ensure everything works the way you need it to.

#### Summary
Each class requires unique preparation, technically and instructionally. Be ready to engage a diverse group of people. Run through all the labs, and make sure you are familiar with the content in advance of standing in front of a classroom.
