## Module Two: Fundamentals of Teaching Adults

### Keep it practical

* Focus on goals: Some students are forced to be in class, some are there to help their career. Whatever the motivation, adults are selfish and want to know "what is in this for me?" Focus your lessons and anecdotes on their needs and keep it practical. Don't get lost in theory in a beginner course. Be hands-on and give them tools and tips they can use at work. Learn their goals so you can give them what THEY need to succeed in their day to day jobs. 

* Mix it up: Not every person in class wants to speak or answer questions. Provide different ways to engage with the material and adjust your style based on the class. Listening to 5 hours of lecture is not engaging, nor is it fun to do. Break up your delivery, take time to assess if your class is following the material, and change tactics when you see they are struggling.

* Push the problem solving: Most adults need to spend time working through new concepts in a hands-on manner. Encourage students to dig into the labs and other problems. Provide time for them to make the connections between ideas and support them by asking probing questions, providing a framework, and gently pushing them to get to answers through trial and error.

### Respect student experience

* Who cares?: They do, and so do we. Learn enough about your students to provide examples that relate to their jobs. Know enough about the product to be able to explain how it solves their problems. Be sure that the focus is on their needs.

* Create space: The classroom can be a place or discovery and fun, or it can be a stressful miserable place. You get to choose. Establish agreed up on ground rules for particpating and problem solving. Remind students that everyone is here to learn, and questions are encourgaed. Stop disruptions with a polite but firm interruption. Don't allow one student to dominate the direction of the course. Focus on the lesson plans and what the majority needs.

* Tips instead of talk: Students are excited to work with you. You're the Puppet expert and they listen to what you say--especially if you complain. Provide them with supported practices and concrete tips. The goal should be for them to leave your class with a complete toolkit to succeed with Puppet.

* Control the schedule: Some courses drag while others fly. You are in charge of the timeline and the schedule. Focus on the overall themes for each day and know your schedule. BAdjust the schedule to meet the students' needs. Don't cruise through critical material and don't linger on frustrating tasks that do not add to their take-away.
